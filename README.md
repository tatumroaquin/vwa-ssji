<h3 align="center">Description</h3>

This project is a [PoC](https://www.malwarebytes.com/glossary/proof-of-concept) to demonstrate the SSJI vulnerability in [CVE-2014-7205](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7205), which opens the possibility of RCE (Remote Code Execution) on a target NodeJS Web Server.  

The repository contains two web applications [*what-is-the-year*](./what-is-the-year/) and [*the-cutlery-shop*](./the-cutlery-shop/), both showcase the same vulnerability. Written instructions on how to run each app are contained within their respective folders.
